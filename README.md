# PHPRouter

Basic PHP MVC routing system currently with no database, no nothing but the routing !


## How to use
### MVC

MVC (model, view, controller) is a programming design to seperate logic, display and concepts such as users and pages.
E.G yoursite.com/**Page**/**index** is calling the "**index**" method within the class "**page**".



### Folders

- **application/controllers** - Contains your controllers, the routing system points you here !
- **application/models** - Models for use within your controllers, a user class for accessing and changing your user database?
- **application/views** - Used within the controllers to output stuff to your display in a convenient way
